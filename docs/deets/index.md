`Ctrl + Shift + P` and see your markdown rendered instantly. Live preview updates as you type.

Relative paths? Absolute paths? Don't worry, ThiefMD finds the images you're looking for.

A separate window lets allows for better positioning, or multi-monitor support. Focus on your writing, or focus on your reading.

Customize the results with [Export Styles](/tips/export-styles). Just a little CSS, and you can see how the results will look on your blog, PDF, or ePUB. [See what people have shared](https://themes.thiefmd.com/export-css).

## Compilation & Multi-Format Export

<div class="responsive-left-short hoffman"><img src="/images/export_menu.png" alt="ThiefMD showing the export menu" /></div>

Writing a novel is no easy feat. Epic undertakings are easier to accomplish broken down into feasible tasks. The same thing goes for [great writing](/tips/novel-writing).

ThiefMD supports [exporting your work](/tips/novel-writing#sharing-your-work) from multiple folders and files.

Publish to PDF to send to friends over e-mail. [ePub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) if you want to preview your novel in your favorite e-Reader. docx or LaTeX if you're getting ready to turn in that report or dissertation.

However large the task and wherever you need to take it, ThiefMD has you covered[^okay-its-pandoc].

[^okay-its-pandoc]: Export powered by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org). [Let us know](https://github.com/kmwallio/ThiefMD/issues) if we don't have you covered.

## Write-Good

<div class="responsive-right jonas"><img src="/images/write-good.png" alt="ThiefMD highlighting and suggesting writing improvements" /></div>

[Write-good](https://github.com/ThiefMD/libwritegood-vala) <span style="background: #0b8370; color: #FFF" title="Passive voice found, be active">was added</span> to ThiefMD to help check for passive voice.

Powered by logic stolen from [btford/write-good](https://github.com/btford/write-good), ThiefMD can help improve your writing.

No more:
* Weasel words
* Passive voice
* Long and Complex Sentences
* Meaningless Wordy Words
* *and more*

Toggle it on, or toggle it off. They're <span style="background: #20528c; color: #FFF" title="Weak word found, be forceful">only</span> suggestions. <span style="background: #564a5e; color: #FFF" title="This sentence is very hard to read">Whether you've found your voice, looking for your voice, or writing in multiple voices, ThiefMD will help you get to where you want to be.</span>

## Typewriter Scrolling

![ThiefMD's typewriter scrolling feature](/images/typewriter_scrolling.gif)

Stay centered and stay focused. Type writer scrolling keeps your active line fixed, both in the editor and the preview.

No longer look for where you're typing keep your eye muscles on what matters most.

## YAML Frontmatter

<div class="responsive-right marcel"><img src="/images/jekyll-minimark.png" alt="ThiefMD rendering YAML frontmatter" /></div>

Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), or another [Static Site Generator](https://www.staticgen.com/)?

ThiefMD surfaces the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter) in the Folder View using minimark.

Live preview also renders any `title:` making your post look like art.

Our [export logic](/tips/novel-writing#novel-metadata) also understands [whatever metadata you may throw at it](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata).

<div class="clear"></div>

## KaTeX Support

<div class="responsive-left jonas"><img src="/images/katex_preview.png" alt="ThiefMD rendering a complex math formula" /></div>

We do not like math, but we'll support it.

Use [KaTeX](https://katex.org) to render Math Equations in Previews.

This requires libmarkdown 2.2.0 or greater. Using [flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.kmwallio.thiefmd) will let ThiefMD use the latest and greatest versions of its dependencies. Ubuntu 20.04 won't have Math Previews, but Fedora 32+ and Ubuntu 20.10 will.

For more power, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) export will have you looking professional.

Export and finalize your work in [TeXstudio](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.texstudio.TeXstudio), [Setzer](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.cvfosammmm.Setzer), or your favorite LaTeX editor.

The sky's the limit, and ThiefMD will help get you there.

## Syntax Highlighting

<div class="responsive-right hoffman"><img src="/images/syntax_preview.png" alt="ThiefMD syntax highlighting Vala code in various colors" /></div>

Writing a dev blog? Updating your [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx)?

[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) makes code shine. And since it's in ThiefMD, ThiefMD will make your code shine too!

I guess it's true what they say: the magic was inside ThiefMD all along.

## Import from almost Anywhere

<div class="responsive-left-short marcel"><img src="/images/import-epub.png" /></div>

Already started your work in [LibreOffice Writer](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer)? Published your ePUB but need to make some changes? ThiefMD has your back.

Whether you're stealing something from the Public Domain or improving your own work, ThiefMD won't judge you. ThiefMD will assist you.

DocX, Odt, HTML, and other file acronyms can be dragged into the Library. Watch in wonder as they convert to Markdown under the covers.

Once you've made your changes, feel free to export them back. Or even [export them to something else](/tips/novel-writing#sharing-your-work).

<div class="clear"></div>

## Theme Support

<div class="responsive-right jonas"><img src="/images/theme_preferences.png" alt="ThiefMD skinned in various vibrant colors" /></div>

Light Theme, Dark Theme, Pink or Blue, make ThiefMD unique to you.

Browse [themes created for ThiefMD](https://themes.thiefmd.com/), or import your favorite [Ulysses Themes](https://styles.ulysses.app/themes)[^ulysses-the-best]. If you're feeling daring, [make your own with our theme generator](https://themes.thiefmd.com/howto).

[^ulysses-the-best]: [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app) is our writing tool of choice on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) and our [theme generator](https://themes.thiefmd.com/howto) is a great way to make us match. ThiefMD is not affiliated with Ulysses.

In the Preferences Window (`Ctrl + ,`), you can now drag themes into the app.

Get immersed and match the whole UI or keep the colors for your words.

Discover more themes at [https://themes.thiefmd.com](https://themes.thiefmd.com) or [make your own](https://themes.thiefmd.com/howto) from scratch.
